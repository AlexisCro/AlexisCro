# Who am I ? 

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alexis Crozier.
I worked during 8 years in hospitals and for the last 3 years I was the referent technician IT. After this 3 years I've decided to change of life and start a class to become a developer. 

So actually I'm an alternate junior developer at Per-Angusta as firm and ISITECH as school. 

I like web technologies and I use HTML/CSS/JS and Ruby on Rails. 

# Per-Angusta

## Technologies used
Per-Angusta uses different technologies, here an non-exhaustive list :
  - HTML / ERB
  - CSS / SCSS / BOOTSTRAP
  - JS / JQuery
